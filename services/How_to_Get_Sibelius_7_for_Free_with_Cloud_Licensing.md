# How to Get Sibelius 7 for Free with Cloud Licensing
 
Sibelius 7 is a powerful music notation software that allows you to create, edit, and print scores of any complexity. However, it is not a free software and you need a valid license to use it. If you are looking for a way to get Sibelius 7 for free, you might be interested in the new cloud licensing system that Avid introduced in December 2021[^1^].

Cloud licensing is a simple and flexible way to activate and move your license from one computer to another. You don't need to worry about license files, activation codes, or seat counts. You just need to run Sibelius 7, click Activate, and log in with your Avid account. Your license will be automatically synced with the cloud and you can start working on your music. You can also use Sibelius 7 offline for up to seven days and your license will reconnect when you're back online[^1^].
 
If you want to use Sibelius 7 on more than one computer, you can do that too. Sibelius 7 comes with two seats: one flexible seat that allows you to use the cloud license on any computer you need to, and one offline activation that allows you to use Sibelius 7 without internet connection for a longer period of time. To move your offline activation to another computer, you need to deactivate it from the License page in Avid Link[^1^].
 
So how can you get Sibelius 7 for free with cloud licensing? The answer is simple: you can sign up for a free trial of Sibelius 7 on the Avid website and enjoy all the features of the software for 30 days. During this period, you can use the cloud licensing system to activate and move your license as many times as you want. You can also use the offline activation option if you need to work without internet access. After the trial period ends, you can either buy a subscription or a perpetual license of Sibelius 7, or cancel your account and uninstall the software[^2^].
 
Cloud licensing is a great way to try out Sibelius 7 for free and see if it suits your needs. It is also a convenient and reliable way to manage your license and use Sibelius 7 on different computers. However, be aware that cloud licensing is not a way to pirate or crack Sibelius 7. You still need a valid Avid account and a license entitlement to use the software. If you try to use any illegal or unauthorized methods to get Sibelius 7 for free, such as downloading license.bin files or patching exe files, you might risk damaging your computer or violating the terms of service[^3^]. Therefore, we recommend that you use the official cloud licensing system and enjoy Sibelius 7 legally and safely.
