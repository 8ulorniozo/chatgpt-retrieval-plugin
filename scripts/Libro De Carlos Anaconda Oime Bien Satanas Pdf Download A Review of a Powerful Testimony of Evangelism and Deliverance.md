Carlos Annacondia was born in 1944 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He grew up in a Catholic family, but he was not very religious. He became a successful businessman, owning several companies and living a comfortable life. However, he felt empty and dissatisfied with his life.
 
In 1979, he had a dramatic encounter with God that changed his life forever. He heard a voice telling him to surrender his life to Jesus Christ. He obeyed and experienced a radical transformation. He felt a new joy and peace in his heart. He also felt a strong urge to share the gospel with others.
 
He started to preach in the poor neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, where he witnessed many signs and wonders. People were healed, delivered, and converted by the power of God. His ministry grew rapidly and attracted thousands of people to his crusades. He also founded the Missionary Movement Message of Salvation, which is still active today.
 
Carlos Annacondia has traveled to more than 50 countries, preaching the gospel and training other evangelists. He has written several books, including War Against Hell and The Truth Will Set You Free. He is considered one of the most influential leaders of the revival movement in Latin America.
  
Carlos Annacondia has a simple and powerful message that he proclaims in his crusades: God and the devil exist and are in permanent battle with each other. By accepting Christ, individuals gain access to divine power in order to overcome Satan. As Annacondia put it: âThe mission of the Devil is to rob, murder, and destroy. Christâs mission is to save and give life.â[^4^]
 
Annacondia also emphasizes the importance of forgiveness as a key to spiritual freedom and healing. He says: âForgiveness is not a feeling, it is a decision. If you want to forgive, the Lord will help you do it.â[^3^] He shares his own testimony of how he forgave his father who had abandoned him when he was a child, and how that brought reconciliation and restoration to his family.
 
Annacondia is not only an evangelist, but also a mentor and a teacher. He has trained thousands of pastors and leaders in evangelism and deliverance ministry. He has also written several books to equip the Church with biblical and practical insights on how to advance Godâs kingdom on earth. Some of his books are: Listen to Me, Satan!, War Against Hell, The Truth Will Set You Free, and Humbled.
